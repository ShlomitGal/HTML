I don't really know how it happened.. But within a year, nearly five years ago, I figured out four close friends of mine, 
plus my husband, 
<br> are Maccabi Haifa fans, So I had to check it out myself 
and I found myself in "Sami Ofer" Stadium for the first time.
<br> As a person who likes to learn and prepare for any scenario, 
<br> I had to do some "homework": memorize the words to all the cheer songs, 
<br> read a bit about the game and even learn what "Offside" is !!
<br> From the warm-up to the whistle, I was drawn into the situation.
<br>
<br> <b> For the first time in my life, since having diagnosed "social anxiety"
<br> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGqdDdId13g" target="_blank" >  "Selective Mutism" </a> since the age of 5, 
<br> I felt part of something big, part of a group.
<u>That's how I became a Maccabi Haifa fan.</u></b></p>

As the local football association wasn't founded in until July 1928 
<br> there were no officially organized competitions during the season, and the club played only friendly matches.
<br> After a period of inactivity, the club was re-organized in February 1923. 
<br> The club playing a handful of matches during the season, including taking part in a cup competition
<br> which was called "The Hebrew Cup". 
<br> Due to its distance, the club was given a bye to the final, which it lost to Maccabi Nes Tziona 0-2
<br> The club was overshadowed by its city rival Hapoel Haifa, but even in its first years adopted a very adventurous
<br> and offensive style of play based on technique and short passes.
<br> In 1942, the club reached the Israel State Cup final, but was defeated 12-1 by Beitar Tel Aviv in the final.
<br> Maccabi Haifa remained a small club that spent most of its time shifting between Liga Leumit and the lower leagues.
<br> In 1962, the team defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 5-2 in the State Cup final, and won the first title of the club. 
<br> In 1963 it reached the final again, but lost to Hapoel Haifa 1-0 in the first Haifa derby in State Cup final.
<br> In the 1980s Maccabi Haifa finally entered the 'Israeli' champions' club, clinching the title thrice (in 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1988-89 seasons).
<br> In the 1983-84 season Maccabi Haifa won its first ever championship, under coach Shlomo Sharf 
<br> The Yerukim (Greens) were known for their "all-around-offense" and flashy technique football style.
